# LJ Code 201 - Day 3

Whoa... its almost at the end of class and it seems the day went by so fast. I guess that's a good sign because the class is moving fast. I am really enjoying the grind though because even in just 3 days, I feel like I am already light years ahead of where I was on day 1.

I am already getting use to the IDE with the command line, git, and atom, all tools of which I have never used prior to this class. The code review and lecture from Sam is really filling in the gaps that were not seen with the prework done through Codeacademy class.
